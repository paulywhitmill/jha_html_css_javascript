  		<p id="section-title-chicken">Chicken</p>
  		<p id="section-content">Chickens fall into several classifications. The broiler-fryer can weigh up to 3½ pounds and is usually around 2½ months old. These chickens, as the name implies, are best when broiled or fried. The more flavorful roasters have a higher fat content and therefore are perfect for roasting and rotisserie cooking. They usually range between 2½ and 5 pounds and can be up to 8 months old. Stewing chickens (also called hens, boiling fowl and just plain fowl) usually range in age from 10 to 18 months.</p>

  		<p id="section-title-beef">Beef</p>
  		<p id="section-content">Beef is the culinary name for meat from cattle. Beef can be harvested from bulls, heifers or steers. Its acceptability as a food source varies in different parts of the world.
		Beef muscle meat can be cut into roasts, short ribs or steak (filet mignon, sirloin steak, rump steak, rib steak, rib eye steak, hanger steak, etc.) Some cuts are processed (corned beef or beef jerky), and trimmings, usually mixed with meat from older, leaner cattle, are ground, minced or used in sausages. The blood is used in some varieties of blood sausage.</p>

  	<div id="section-container">
  		<p id="section-title-sushi">Sushi</p>
  		<p id="section-content">There was a time in our little old country when the mention of sushi elicited blank stares (unless, of course, you were one of the privileged few who’d eaten it on your travels to New York, Los Angeles, Tokyo or Hong Kong). Two decades later and sushi is not only readily available at the thousands of Japanese and seafood restaurants around the country, it’s become the food of choice for health-conscious locals wanting to get their daily dose of protein and omega-3 oils without the kilojoules.</p>
